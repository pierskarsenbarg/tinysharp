This is an implementation of [Kyle Bragger](http://kylewritescode.com/)'s tiny code in C#.

# Usage

You can add the project to your solution, compile it to a dll or just copy the tiny.cs file into your solution.

You will need to use Tiny.GenerateSet() to generate a key. Then add this key to the constant at the top so it goes from this:

    private const string _key = "**insert key here**";

to this:

    private const string _key = "HlmsFfTSNvugBbthin85IqGEDX3k6CVpLz1UwMQxWOYoZ7K9aRJjeAdPc24y0r";
